# perplexity_ai_clone

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application using Gemini LLM
Much needed packages for the backend using fastapi include - 
- fastapi
- pydantic
- sentence transformers (to convert content to a vector model and draw a similarity angle between query and results)
- tavily (for getting the sources from web, basically a web crawler)
- trafilatura (for extracting the information from the provided resources)
- websockets (for bidirectional communication between client and server)

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
